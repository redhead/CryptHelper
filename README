It can:
	- analyze given encrypted text 
	- show the index of coincidence of the text
	- show a table of character frequencies clearly
	- show a graph chart rendering the frequencies
	- add English or Czech character frequencies next to the text frequencies
	- offset the English/Czech character frequencies to ease discovering 'shift ciphers'
